Computer Scheduling:CPU scheduling is a process which allows one process to use the CPU while the execution of another process is on hold(in waiting state) due to unavailability of any resource like I/O etc, thereby making full use of CPU. The aim of CPU scheduling is to make the system efficient, fast and fair.Whenever the CPU becomes idle, the operating system must select one of the processes in the ready queue to be executed. The selection process is carried out by the short-term scheduler (or CPU scheduler). The scheduler selects from among the processes in memory that are ready to execute, and allocates the CPU to one of them.

There are six popular process scheduling algorithms.

First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) Scheduling

Shortest-Job-Next (SJN) Scheduling

Priority Scheduling

Shortest Remaining Time

Round Robin(RR) Scheduling

Multiple-Level Queues Scheduling.

These algorithms are either non-preemptive or preemptive. Non-preemptive algorithms are designed so that once a process enters the running state, it cannot be preempted until it completes its allotted time, whereas the preemptive scheduling is based on priority where a scheduler may preempt a low priority running process anytime when a high priority process enters into a ready state.

//We implemented some of these Scheduling Algorithms in java.
